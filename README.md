# odin-recipes

I’ve just completed building a basic recipe website to practice all the HTML skills I’ve learned. The site consists of a main index page with links to several recipes. While the design is simple, this project was focused on solidifying my understanding of HTML. I’m looking forward to revisiting it later to style with CSS.

What I Learned:

1. Structuring HTML documents with proper tags.
2. Creating internal links between different pages.
3. Organizing content with headings and lists.
4. Using images and links in a web page.
